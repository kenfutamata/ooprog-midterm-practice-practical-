 Create an abstract class named Element that holds properties of elements, including
their symbol, atomic number, and atomic weight. Include a constructor that requires
values for all three properties and a get method for each value. (For example, the
symbol for carbon is C, its atomic number is 6, and its atomic weight is 12.01. You
can find these values by reading a periodic table in a chemistry reference or by
searching the Web.) Also include an abstract method named describeElement().
Create two extended classes named MetalElement and NonMetalElement. Each
contains a describeElement() method that displays the details of the element and
a brief explanation of the properties of the element type. For example, metals are
good conductors of electricity, while nonmetals are poor conductors. Write an
application named ElementArray that creates and displays an array that holds at
least two elements of each type. Save the files as Element.java, MetalElement.java,
NonMetalElement.java, and ElementArray.java.
